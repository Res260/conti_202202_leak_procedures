This is how we ping hosts
1. CREATE A TXT FILE ON THE DESKTOP WITH THE NAME domains.txt
2. IF YOU HAVE A VARIETY OF UNITS OR JUST LOCAL COMPUTER NAMES, WE PUT THEM IN THIS FILE
3. WE FILL IT ON THE MACHINE (C:\ProgramData\) FROM WHICH THE PING FILE WILL GO domains.txt and p.bat
4. RUN p.bat USING THE shell
5 COMMAND. AFTER PING, DOWNLOAD THE FILE res.txt
